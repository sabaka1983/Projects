## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

In this project I used CSS, HTML and flexbox.
Flexbox was used to center and arrange objects on the page.
I used position and transform to place the footer at the bottom of the page.
In the project, I used the <picture> tag to change the image displayed.
