## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

In this project I used CSS, HTML and flexbox.<br>
Flexbox was used to center and arrange objects on the page.<br>
I used position and transform to place the footer at the bottom of the page.<br>
In the project, I used the ``` @media ``` to change flexbox direction.
